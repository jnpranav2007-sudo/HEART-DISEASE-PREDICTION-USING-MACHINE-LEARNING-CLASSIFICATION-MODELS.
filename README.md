❤️ MY MAJOR PROJECT ON HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION MODELS

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient using machine learning models. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals with early diagnosis and preventive care.
---

📌 **Project Overview**
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Predicting heart disease at an early stage can help doctors provide timely treatment. This project uses the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** and applies multiple machine-learning algorithms to classify whether a person is at risk.
---

📊 **Dataset**
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Records:** 303 patient entries  
- **Target Variable:**  
  - `1` → Heart Disease Present  
  - `0` → No Heart Disease  
---

🧠 **Models Used**
The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier  
---

📈 **AUC Score Comparison**

| Model | AUC Score |
|-------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.86 |
| Decision Tree | 0.78 |
| Random Forest | 0.89 |
| SVM | 0.88 |
| KNN | 0.82 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.91 |

✔ **Gradient Boosting** performed the best.

🔍 **ROC Curve Output**
The ROC curve shows the trade-off between TPR and FPR.  **AUC Score: 0.89**, which indicates excellent model performance.
---

🧪 **Technologies Used**
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn
