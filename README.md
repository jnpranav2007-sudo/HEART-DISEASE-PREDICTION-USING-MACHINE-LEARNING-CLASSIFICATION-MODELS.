📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Predicting heart disease at an early stage can help doctors provide timely treatment. 
This project uses the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** and applies multiple machine-learning algorithms to classify whether a person is at risk.
